# Project: Google Homepage

## The Odin Project - Web Development 101

In this mini-project I deconstructed the google homepage and rebuilt it in VS Code. The main parts of the page are present, however positioning and colouring of some parts are not perfect. This could be corrected with further adjustment.

The outcome of this mini-project is that it increased my familiartiy with HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub. And gave me a better understanding of how websites are built and how they work.
